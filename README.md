## Description
This is a 5V logic level probe constructed for the Electronic System Prototyping course (EE 13) at Caltech. It is based on an AT90S441 AVR with a PAL16V8 for preprocessing of the input. The probe may be used as a voltmeter (0 - 5V) and simple logic analyzer that displays frequency or duty cycle on a set of three seven-segment displays.

Designed with DipTrace v.3.3.1.0. Gerber files may be found in `/gerber`.
